Test script to verify Demonling installation and dependencies.
Run this before running the main game to ensure everything is set up correctly.

This script checks:
1. Python version compatibility
2. Required dependencies (Kivy, KivyMD, Pillow)
3. Optional dependencies for mobile builds (Buildozer, Kivy-iOS)
